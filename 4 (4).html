                <h2>Creation History</h2>
                <p>"Jujutsu Kaisen" is the brainchild of manga artist Gege Akutami. The first chapter was published in *Weekly Shōnen Jump* on March 5, 2018. Akutami had already made his debut with a short one-shot, but *Jujutsu Kaisen* quickly outshone his earlier work. The manga stands out for its combination of dark fantasy, horror, and martial arts, and its roots are heavily influenced by Akutami’s inspirations, including *Yu Yu Hakusho* and *Hunter x Hunter* by Yoshihiro Togashi.</p>
                <p>Akutami has stated that he wanted to explore the concepts of curses as an embodiment of human negative emotions. This metaphor allows him to dive into deep psychological and philosophical issues, creating a rich universe where curses are not just enemies but reflections of the darker side of human nature.</p>

                <h2>Development Process</h2>
                <p>During the development of *Jujutsu Kaisen*, Akutami aimed to create a world where supernatural elements are intertwined with everyday life. The setting is grounded in Tokyo, but the presence of curses and sorcerers adds a thrilling, otherworldly element. Akutami took care to develop intricate characters with detailed backstories, and his narrative choices often reflect difficult ethical dilemmas and the concept of personal responsibility.</p>
                <p>The serialization of the manga quickly led to its adaptation into an anime, produced by *MAPPA*. The anime first aired in October 2020 and garnered high praise for its dynamic animation, especially during fight scenes, as well as its faithful representation of Akutami’s vision.</p>

                <h2>Release Dates and Milestones</h2>
